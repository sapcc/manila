    When deferred deletion is enabled, Manila will attempt regular deletion.
    While quota is released, and these objects (shares, snapshots) are hidden
    from the user. Any error during deferred deletion will put resource in
    `error_deferred_deleting` state. After that, it will be handled in
    periodic task. Also, Manila will make sure snapshot instances are deleted
    before share instance delete. For more details, please check
    Launchpad `bug 2068043 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2068043>`_
