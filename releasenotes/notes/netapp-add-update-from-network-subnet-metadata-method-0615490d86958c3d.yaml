    The NetApp ONTAP driver is now able to update the `showmount` and
    `pnfs` configurations in a pre-created share server. Please use the
    share network subnet metadata set feature to update these values. The
    valid values for those metadata keys are 'true/false'.
    Also note, earlier support of updating `showmount` using share metadata
    is removed since its supported now by share network subnet metadata.
