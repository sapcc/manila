    OpenStack operators can now make use of a new config option named
    `driver_updatable_subnet_metadata` to determine which share network
    subnet metadata updates the back end driver needs to be notified about.
    The config option contains list of share network subnet metadata keys.
    When the share network subnet's metadata gets updated and Manila
    identifies that the new metadata keys match the metadata keys from the
    provided list, the share back end will be notified and it will apply
    the necessary changes. The result will be communicated through user
    messages. This feature is supported from microversion '2.89'. Since,
    with share network migration, metadata belonging to the old share network
    subnet is ignored when moving to a new share network, updates will not
    be passed to new share servers.
