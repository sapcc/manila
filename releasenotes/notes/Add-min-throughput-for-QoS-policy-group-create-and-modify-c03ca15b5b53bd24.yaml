    NetApp ONTAP driver is updated to consider min-throughput while creating
    and modifying QoS policy. This parameter is considered only when admin has
    configured it via share-type extra-specs. The extra-specs should have only
    any single key from the list of ['netapp:miniops', 'netapp:miniopspergib',
    'netapp:minbps', 'netapp:minbpspergib'].
