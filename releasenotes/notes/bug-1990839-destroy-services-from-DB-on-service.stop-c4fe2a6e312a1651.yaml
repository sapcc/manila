    In cluster deployments, where multiple instances of manila-scheduler are
    deployed via PODs, unique hostname is derived from node name. However if
    pods are deployed again and launched on new hosts/nodes, the old entries
    of manila-scheduler remains as it is. Fixed it by deleting DB entries
    after service.stop() and creating new entries again in service.start().
