    NetApp driver: When manila share server is in error state and backend
    vserver is not created, but DB objects for share server and share are
    present. In order to correctly perform share deletion, we should
    check vserver existence with the cluster client instead of tunneling to
    the vserver client. For more details, please refer to
    `launchpad bug #1964592 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1964592>`_
