    NetApp driver `bug #2100835
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2100835>`_:
    The NetApp driver now supports to prevent the creation of a share
    server if the total number of data LIFs on one node of HA pair,
    including those that can be migrated in case of failure,exceeds the
    maximum number data LIFs supported by the node. This option guarantees
    that, in the event of a node failure, the partner node will be able to
    takeover all data LIFs.
